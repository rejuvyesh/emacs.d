;; Version: 1.0.0

;;; Commentary:

;; To install, Load this library
;;
;;   (require 'mc-jump)
;;
;; and bind keys.
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "M-m") 'mc-jump-char)
;;
;; Now "M-m a" will jump to the next occurence of "a", for example. You may
;; press "a" again and again to browse more matches.

;; "mc-jump-char" is designed to be used with "multiple-cursors". That is,
;; you may also use this command to move all pseudo cursors. Still, this
;; command does not depend on "multiple-cursors".
