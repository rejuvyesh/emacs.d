org-toc helps you to have an up-to-date table of contents in org files
without exporting (useful primarily for readme files on GitHub).

After installation put into your .emacs file something like

(eval-after-load "org-toc-autoloads"
  '(progn
     (if (require 'org-toc nil t)
         (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-toc-enable)
       (warn "org-toc not found"))))

And every time you'll be saving an org file, the first headline with a :TOC:
tag will be updated with the current table of contents.
